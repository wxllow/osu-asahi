# OSU Asahi

A script to automatically build and install osu! (lazer) and its dependencies natively on ARM64 Linux (ex. Asahi Linux).

## Run

```bash
sh <(curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wxllow/osu-asahi/main/osu-asahi.sh)
```

## Current Limitations

- [ ] **Scores will not be submitted due to being an "unofficial build"** :\(
- [ ] Only designed/tested for Fedora 40, but should work with other distros if SDL2 and dotnet SDK 8.0 are installed.
